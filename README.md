# ZMarkdown Experiments

A collection of tools closely linked to [ZMarkdown](https://github.com/zestedesavoir/zmarkdown), some of which might eventually get merged into the main repository someday. Currently contains:

- `escape-list`, a procedure to generate the list of KaTeX-compatible commands for LaTeX escaping;
- `microbber`, proof-of-work of a micromark-compatible LaTeX frontend (without AST);
- `publisher`, a tool allowing to publish a content with a manifest but without the complete ZdS server;
- `specification`, the compiled specification for ZMarkdown (next).

Everything is published without any warranty. Some packages might even be completely outdated, as they are not always published immediately. In a word: expectations about any tool from this repository are pointless.
